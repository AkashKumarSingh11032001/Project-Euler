# Project-Euler
 Trying Solving Project Euler Problem with very simple  Python3 code

Q1 : Basic knowledge needed! you just need to pick out number that are Multiple by both 3 and 5.

Q2 : Not a fast & furious concept needed! you just need to print Fibonacci Numbers.

Q3 : Basic Level Code! you need to find prime factor and then pick out the max prime factor.

Q4 : Here! we come to some trick problem, In this question we need to find the palidromic number that means we need to pick out the two number that helps to make a pallidrom.
 
Q5 : This was a basic level looping question! just you need to loop over and find a digit that was divisible by each value in the assigned range.

Q6 : In this I created Two function one for 'sum of square' and other for 'square of sum' and rest just substract one from other.

Q7 : Literally! No will tell you the simplest way to handle this question. Please have a Look

Q8 : In this question , I used simple list comprehension method and slicing, every this is mention in my code, See it's a simple question with tricky explanation.

Q9 : Don't frighten from name itself (Ah! i got frighten too), You just need to find the three number whiich satisfy pythagoreanous theorym overall question imply that if a ,b ,c satisfy this a^2 +b^2 = c^2 then just add a+b+c.

Q10 : Again for you only, i did this question in very compact manner, in this you just needed to find all prime number in under the given range , then just add it.That's All!

Q11 : Actually I completed this question but the main resone for not to post here is that it take about 89 sec to give result,So i'm trying to improve that.

Q12 : Here once again , we don't needed any fast and furious concept ro solve this question , Please have a look on code.

Q13 : Simply Sum each line and just print first 10 number.

Q14 : This question I done with C language but got an error while excuting with python, still trying but needed sometime. Sorry for your inconvinience!

Q15 : 

Q16 : In this question you just need to find the nth power of 2 and then just split the value and add it.
